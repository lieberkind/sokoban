## Credits
This game is a direct port of Allan B. Liss' Sokoban for Windows release 2.2.5
from 1992. I don't take credit for invention of levels, gameplay or any design.

## Thanks to
Thanks to Jens Peter Lieberkind for helping me discover bugs and weird behaviours, and for proposing feature enhancements.
